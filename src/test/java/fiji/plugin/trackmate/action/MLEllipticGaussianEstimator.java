/**
 * An fit initializer suitable for the fitting of elliptic orthogonal gaussians
 * ({@link EllipticGaussianOrtho}, ellipse axes must be parallel to image axes)
 * functions on n-dimensional image data. It uses plain maximum-likelihood
 * estimator for a normal distribution.
 * <p>
 * The problem dimensionality is specified at construction by the length of the
 * typical sigma array.
 * <p>
 * The domain span size is simply set to be
 * <code>1 + 2 x ceil(typical_sigma)</code> in each dimension.
 * <p>
 * Parameters estimation returned by
 * {@link #initializeFit(Localizable, Observation)} is based on
 * maximum-likelihood estimator for a normal distribution, which requires the
 * background of the image (out of peaks) to be close to 0. Returned parameters
 * are ordered as follow:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 0 → ndims-1		x₀ᵢ
 * ndims.			A
 * ndims+1 → 2 × ndims	bᵢ = 1 / σᵢ²
 * </pre>
